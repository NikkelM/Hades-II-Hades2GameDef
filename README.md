For mod developers only!
Community sourced [definition files](https://luals.github.io/wiki/definition-files/) using [luaCATS annotations](https://luals.github.io/wiki/annotations/), for Hades 2 in the context of [ReturnOfModding](https://github.com/SGG-Modding/Hell2Modding).

# Contributing
Contribute to this project by adding informative descriptions or annotations to the `base.lua` (fields defined from the engine as part of base lua), `engine.lua` (other fields defined from the engine), `load.lua` (fields available only after a save loads), and any lua files in the `Scripts` folder.    

Check out the `dev` branch and Make a PR to it with your changes, and review other PRs. Eventually by enough merges they will be rolled into a release in the `main` branch.
